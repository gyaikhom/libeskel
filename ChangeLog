	* PREAMBLE
	This is final working library with preamble messages.

	* SUMMARY
	Improved summary generation code. Now separated from PEPA.

	* MEM
	Introduced memory accountant. The set of interfaces are internal
	to the eSkel library, and is used to check memory leaks within the
	library implementation. [The excellent Valgrind is sometimes hard
	to use with multiple processes.]

	* SCHED
	Error checking support for failure at scheduler
	initialisation: disables the dynamic scheduling support.

	* NICE
	There is now a theoretical computation of the expected CPU
	availability based on the nice values of all the user processes
	currently alive. This value will be used when the contribution of
	a process to the total utilisation '->contrib' is zero.

	* TIMING
	Timing is now working. Median is used instead of average. Somehow,
	the first mesaurement of the task duration is unusually large. I
	think it is because I am executing all the processes on the same
	node. Should run it on the Beowulf.

	* STATE
	Made lots of lovely changes for handling state transfer. It
	seems that eskel_state_commit() is more important than ever. For
	example, if some state is registered in one task and if this task
	is switched between two nodes alternatively, the node leaving the
	execution of this task should send the existing state. This,
	however cannot be done until eskel_state_commit() is executed, or
	the node enters the wait state. For this, some significant changes
	have been introduced.

	1. No more eskel_state_commit(). Replaced by eskel_begin() which
	should be invoked after registering the states, but before
	entering the task loop.
	2. Replaced "return ESKEL_COMPLETED" with a corresponding
	eskel_end() which should be invoked as the last function before
	the task function exists.
